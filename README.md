## Summary
A few things to keep in mind from this module:

- Always use the promises namespace on the built-in modules. You can then use the async and await operators to make code synchronous without blocking program execution.
- Whenever you are creating a directory, make sure that you wrap it in a try/catch. The default behavior in Node.js is to throw an error when you try to create a directory that already exists. If you just want to check if a directory exists or not, you can use the stat method. Note that this method does not exist on the promises namespace, but on the main fs object.
- If you need to parse other file types, check out the packages on npmjs.org. For example, you can use the [papaparse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/papaparse) package for .csv files. You can use the [fixy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fixy) package for fixed-width files.
